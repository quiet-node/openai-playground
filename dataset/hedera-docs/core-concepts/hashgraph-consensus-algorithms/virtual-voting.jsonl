It allows members to calculate every other member's votes locally without sending votes across the network. This approach helps in saving bandwidth, ensures fair and secure properties, and guarantees Byzantine agreement. Virtual voting happens in 3 steps: divide rounds, decide fame, and find order."}]}

In the virtual voting process of the Hashgraph algorithm, the first step is to divide rounds, where rounds and witnesses are defined. The next step is to decide fame, which involves determining whether a witness is famous or not based on the votes from the following round. Finally, the algorithm finds the order of events based on the round received, consensus timestamp, and signature."}]}

It starts by identifying the round \(r\) for each event, then determines if the event can strongly see a certain number of witnesses in the current round. If so, the event is assigned to the next round. The procedure also defines the witness for each event, taking into account its relationship with its parent events."}]}

A famous witness is one that is widely acknowledged by the witnesses in the next round, while a non-famous witness lacks such acknowledgment.
