This community-accepted standard allows most tooling on the Hedera network to scrape and interpret metadata, enabling features like NFT explorers listing rarity attributes based on the metadata."}]}

When creating a non-fungible token using the Hedera Token Service, developers set the metadata value to the metadata JSON file to define the NFT, wherever it's stored. The 'memo' or 'symbol' fields on the NFT are not allowed for this purpose."}]}
