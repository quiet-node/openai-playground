You can also use an alternative with 'git' and SSH by following the provided command. Then, in the terminal, from the 'hello-future-world' directory, enter the subdirectory for this sequence using the command 'cd 00-create-fund-account/'. After that, install the dependencies using 'npm' with the command 'npm install', and make a '.env' file by copying the provided '.env.sample' file using the command 'cp .env.sample .env'. Finally, open the '.env' file in a code editor, such as VS Code, to continue with creating and funding an account on the Hedera Testnet."}]}

After completing the account creation process on the Hedera Portal, you should copy-paste the confirmation code sent to your email and fill out the form as guided. Then, select Hedera Testnet from the drop-down in the top-left, copy the value of 'HEX Encoded Private Key', and replace 'ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY' in the '.env' file with it. Next, copy the value of 'Account ID' from the Hedera Portal, and replace 'ACCOUNT_ID' in the '.env' file with it. Finally, save your files and you are ready to start using your Hedera Testnet account from the portal within script files on your computer for the next steps in the account creation process."}]}
