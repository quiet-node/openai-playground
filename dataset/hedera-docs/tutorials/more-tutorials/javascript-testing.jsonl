Instead, the test runner generates random input values to use in the tests. It provides an additional layer of verification for the system under test by testing it with a new set of input values each time the tests are run. It is incorporated into the JavaScript testing process on the Hedera network using plugins like `testcheck.js` to enable generative testing within the test runner."}]},
