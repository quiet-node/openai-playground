It is used to deploy the smart contract onto the Hedera network. On the other hand, the runtime bytecode, also known as deployed bytecode, is the EVM bytecode that is stored and executed on the network after the smart contract has been deployed. The creation bytecode is used for deployment, while the runtime bytecode is what is ultimately executed and utilized by the network."}]}
