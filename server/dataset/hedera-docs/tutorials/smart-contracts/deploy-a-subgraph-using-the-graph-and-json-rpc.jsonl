This allows developers to easily query the indexed data through a GraphQL API, creating robust backends for dApps. Subgraphs simplify the process of obtaining blockchain/network data for developers building dApps, removing the complexities of interacting directly with the network."}]}

In other words, if ERC-like operations are conducted on HTS tokens, not all of them will be captured in smart contract event logging."}]}
