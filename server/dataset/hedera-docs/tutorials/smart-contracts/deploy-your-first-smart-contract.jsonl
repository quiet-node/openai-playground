Get a Hedera testnet account and set up your environment using the provided links.\n2. Create a 'Hello Hedera' smart contract in Solidity using the Remix IDE.\n3. Store the bytecode of the smart contract on the Hedera network using the FileCreateTransaction() API or the CreateContractFlow() API.\n4. Deploy the smart contract on Hedera by setting the bytecode file ID and providing the constructor parameters using the ContractCreateTransaction() API.\n5. Interact with the deployed smart contract by calling its functions, such as get_message and set_message, using the ContractCallQuery() and ContractExecuteTransaction() APIs."}]}
